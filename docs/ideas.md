# Innovative Idea

A platform that allows UMass students to share their good experience on campus. They could post food recommendations around campus, interesting club they recommend others to join, or a good location to study. They can also share any good resources on campus, such as LRC and CCPH. Any good experience or resources they could share with other students on campus is great. Users can post data such as images, time, locations, etc., and other users can post their comments and thoughts on the comment section. We are going to call the application UShare. Some existing popular experience sharing apps includes Instagram and Pinterest. Comparing to these existing apps, our web application is going to be specifically focusing on UMass students. Users are going to share their experience relate to UMass campus, and they are also going to post pictures and the specific location on campus. Moreover, Instagram and Pinterest are mainly focused on sharing images, in our app, text contents and images are going to have equal importance.
